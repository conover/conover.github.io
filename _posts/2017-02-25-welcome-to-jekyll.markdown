JavaScript, as language, is a mess is a lot of ways. Here is an example: [typeof null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof#null)). TypeScript helps to reduce this chaos to a somewhat manageable level. While it's important to remember that it's only syntatic sugar, the illusion of strong typing is better than nothing. In my opinion, utilizing TypeScript for projects that are any larger than toy-sized is a must.
